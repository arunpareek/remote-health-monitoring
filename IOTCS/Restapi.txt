Arun,

Just to understand....

- It looks like you successfully registered and activated the device through the APIs.
- It looks like this is a directly connected device, not using a gateway.
- It looks like you successfully sent messages from the device TO IoT.

So the issue is trying to go through IoT CS to send a message TO the device?  Because it looks like you are trying to send a message FROM the device.

Is there a reason you are using the v1/messages API rather than v2?

Are you wanting to do all this low-level coding or are you just trying to get it to work?  I have some very simple NodeJS code which creates/registers/activates a new device and sends to any given data urn with just a few lines of node code...  Using the Java or Node libraries are a bit easier than sorting out all the rest calls IMHO. :-)

E.g. Node code to register/activate device:
-------------
var IoTServer = require('jsclient/iot');

var iot = new IoTServer('https://iot-gse00002944.iot.us.oraclecloud.com');
iot.setPrincipal("cloud.admin", "upstageTimber9!");

var metadata = {
};
var result = iot.createDevice('upstageTimber9!', 'Anki Car Data', 'DIRECTLY_CONNECTED_DEVICE', metadata)
 .then(function(device) {
   console.log('Device', device.getID(), 'created, now activating...');
   return device.activate();
});

console.log("Result: ", result)
-------------

Code to send a message:
-------
// setup the device

var IoTServer = require('jsclient/iot');

var iot = new IoTServer(iotServerUrl);
iot.setPrincipal(iotUsername, iotPassword);
var mydevice = null;
iot.getDevice(iotDeviceID, iotDevicePassword).then(function(device) {
 console.log("Got device: "+iotDeviceID);
 mydevice = device;
});

---
// later, send message
mydevice.sendDataMessages(urn, body).then(function(response) {
   console.log("Sent msg to urn: "+\urn);
 })

// send alert
mydevice.sendAlerts(urn,title,severity,body).then(function(response) {
   console.log("Sent alert to urn: "+urn);
 })
